# back_to_basic

In 2019 it has been already 20 years since I started programming. This repository features some interesting programs from the first 10 years.

## Description

The programs I present here were not altered, except where alterations were needed to compile the old code with modern compilers.

It all started in 1999 with QBasic. Over the years, I tried (or had to try) different other programming languages. Each of the following folders contains programs from one of the languages with a separate description.

* [QBasic] - This were mostly experiments with pixel graphics. One of the highlights is a text adventure (in German).
